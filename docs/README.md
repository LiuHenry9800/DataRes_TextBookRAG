**Abstract**: Understanding and creating mathematics using natural mathematical language &mdash; the mixture of symbolic and natural language used by humans &mdash; is a challenging and important problem for driving progress in machine learning. As a step in this direction, we develop <span class="small-caps">NaturalProofs</span>, a large-scale dataset of mathematical statements and their proofs, written in natural mathematical language. Using <span class="small-caps">NaturalProofs</span>, we propose a mathematical reference retrieval task that tests a system's ability to determine the key results that appear in a proof. Large-scale sequence models excel at this task compared to classical information retrieval techniques, and benefit from language pretraining, yet their performance leaves substantial room for improvement. <span class="small-caps">NaturalProofs</span> opens many possibilities for future research on challenging mathematical tasks.
